## Folder Structure
Our Django project, research_match, is separated into three different apps: profilepage, inbox, and search. Each of the Frontend is stored in the static and template folders of each app. The static folder holds css files, and the tamplate folder holds html files.

---
## Profilepage - Main app
- admin.py - registers profile model
- apps.py - configuration file

- view.py holds the main functionality of user registration, profile customization, and the matching algorithm.
- urls.py holds the paths to each function
